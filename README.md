It has records of 14999 employees and has 9 features taken into consideration, apart from the target column. I have used various Machine Learning Models to predict the output with accuracy. Random Forest Classifier model worked best for this particular dataset which gave a test accuracy of 99% with approximately 98% recall score. Finally, I have rebuild the model using Neural Network, which gave an accuracy of 97%.
